## Hi there! My name is Patrick 👋

### About Me: 

  I am a student enrolled in the Intro to Data Science course who is interested in learning more about data science practices and applications. By the end of this semester, I aim to learn the necessary skills and strategies to effectively communicate key data insights through visuals and narratives. I also hope to continue to develop my technical skills, such as my proficiency with Python, as well as to learm more about new, useful programs like Tableau.

  This semester, I am currently working on creating projects with Streamlit. So far, I have created a basic app using Streamlit that provides data on the top songs on Spotify for 2/6/25. This project is currently visible in my portfolio.
